# Grubbs Test

Simple script implementation to generate maximum and minimum anomalies in a data set, it is assumed that the data set has a Gaussian distribution. 
When the case of the maximum values of anomalies is considered, it is observed that P (p-values) and T (generated anomalies) have an inversely proportional relationship. 
The more the p-value grows, the smaller the distance T that is needed for this point to be considered an anomaly. 
For the case of the minimum anomalies, the same relationship was found, as the P value increased, the value of T decreased to be considered an anomaly.
